Description
-----------

SHT4x is a digital sensor platform for measuring relative humidity and temperature at different
accuracy classes. The power-trimmed internal heater can be used at three heating levels
thus enabling sensor operation in demanding environments.

* Relative humidity accuracy: up to ±1.5 %RH
* Temperature accuracy: up to ±0.1 °C

.. note::
    The temperature value is the one from the chip, not the environment. It can be used to monitor the sensor temperature when using the heater.

.. warning::
    The heater is designed for a maximal duty cycle of less than 5% when it is periodically heated. Otherwise the sensor might be destroyed.
