UART Interface
==============

.. note::
    UART is a Asynchronous serial interface often used as debug console or interfacing with some sensors. It is connected to the ST-Link debugger to
    allow printf-output to be displayed within the STM32CubeIDE but is also available on the Pmod connectors.
